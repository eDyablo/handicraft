Largest palindrome product

https://projecteuler.net/problem=3

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

10000000a + 1000000b + 100000c + 10000d + 1000d + 100c + 10b + a
